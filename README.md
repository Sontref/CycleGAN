# CycleGAN

*I'm doing this for education and fun.*

### Use guide
I've taken some util and pipeline stuff from another repo (described later).  
I've seen some of these techniques before, so I thought it is the right place to taste them.

Using should be simple (at least after doing some prerequisites).
1. You should have train.py in the same dir (for example, *project/*) as model.py and datasets.py.
2. That *project/* dir **must** also include another dirs: *datasets/*, *saved_models/*, *generated_images*
3. In *datasets/* you should place your dataset directory *\*dataset_name\*/*, which **must** contain:
    * *\*dataset_name\*/testA/*
    * *\*dataset_name\*/testB/*
    * *\*dataset_name\*/trainA/*
    * *\*dataset_name\*/trainB/*
    * In these directories you should store your images.
5. In *saved_models/* and *generated_images/* you **must** create directories named again *\*dataset_name\*/*, where stuff from training will be saved.
6. Execute train.py. Arguments:
    * "--start_from", type=int, default=-1, help="epoch number to start from; -1 for training from scratch"
    * "--num_epochs", type=int, default=200, help="number of epochs"
    * "--dataset_name", type=str, default="horse2zebra", help="name of the dataset"
    * "--batch_size", type=int, default=10, help="number of samples in batch"
    * "--img_height", type=int, default=256, help="image height in pixels"
    * "--img_width", type=int, default=256, help="image width in pixels"
    * "--channels", type=int, default=3, help="number of image channels"
    * "--num_residual", type=int, default=9, help="number of residual blocks"
    * "--lambda_cycle", type=float, default=10.0, help="cycle loss weight"
    * "--lambda_identity", type=float, default=5.0, help="identity loss weight"
7. Model weights will be stored at *project/saved_models/\*dataset_name\*/*;  
   Generated images will be stored at *project/generated_images/\*dataset_name\*/*;

### Progress
For now I've implemented by myself CycleGAN architecture according to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf  

Specifically:  
* Generator model
* Discriminator model
* Training cycle

Also, I didn't want this homework to be another casual .ipynb project, so I decided to split it into modules.  
I've never did this before, deadline is near, but I need to learn this stuff for **Final Project \\[T]/**, so...   
This split was inspired by https://github.com/eriklindernoren/PyTorch-GAN/tree/master/implementations/cyclegan
("Inspired" quite weak word here. In fact I've just copied *most* of his pipeline.)  

Also by deadline reasons some util stuff was taken from that repo.  

Specifically:
* *sample_images* function to generate and store generated fake images in pretty neat way;
* entire logging pipeline; 
* *FakeImageBuffer* was also taken from there. However, maybe here credits should go to original CycleGAN repo: https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix 
* nice stuff with *parser* which I've seen many times before. I'm glad that I've finally made it by myself (particularly).

All another stuff should be written by me if I'm not mistaken.
### Results
TL;DR: quite bad results to be honest.

I have some bad issue here: all my losses just stucked near some points. But I don't see where I've made a mistake.  
Models still learn some stuff, but it's not enough even for horse2zebra transmuting. So I haven't begun my own idea yet.  
AFAIK, my model should be identical to stuff, which were proposed in mentioned paper. Because they described their architecture quite clear=)  
But it's still not so powerful.
Anyway, I have one last chance (by time reasons) to reproduce horse2zebra once more.  
I've added identity loss, which was used in paper, but for another tasks (my images were tinted on generating too; I suppose it can help here too);  
I've added schedulers, because I forgot about decaying for the first time, lol.  
And my **hope**: I forgot about weight initialization as well. Now I've fixed it.
